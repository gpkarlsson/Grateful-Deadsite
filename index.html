        <p>Here I will go into specifics about what it is that I love about these shows I listed</p>
        <h3 id="92070">9/20/70 Fillmore East New York, NY</h3>
        <p><a
            href="https://archive.org/details/gd70-09-20.aud.remaster.sirmick.27583.sbeok.shnf/gd70-09-20d1t01.shn">Click
            here to listen to 9/20/70 at the Fillmore East</a></p>
        <p>This show is divided into two sets, an acoustic first set and electric second set. <br>
          The acoustic first set contains a number of phenomenal songs, starting off with a nice<br>
          "Uncle John's Band." The acoustic version of this song has a nice warm sound to it, and is all around just
          a<br>
          nice feel-good type song. Next up, the band plays "Deep Elem Blues," which for them was not<br>
          a very commonly performed song. The Dead only played "Deep Elem Blues" just under 50 times,<br>
          which is almost nothing considering they played "Playing in the Band" a total of 733 times.<br>
          This "Deep Elem Blues" is a very nice, soulful and bluesy vocal performance by Jerry Garcia.<br>
          After "Deep Elem Blues," they play one of their classic originals - "Friend of the Devil."<br>
          This acoustic "Friend of the Devil" is very nicely accented by both David Grisman and David Nelson sitting<br>
          in with the band playing mandolin. Continuing on, another blues song, "Big Railroad Blues," featuring<br>
          fantastic mandolin accompaniment by both David Grisman and David Nelson. After "Big Railroad Blues," comes<br>
          "Dark Hollow" which again features mandolin accompaniment by Grisman and Nelson. This time, however, it is<br>
          Bob Weir singing lead vocals. Next on the set list, is arguably one of, if not the best version of
          "Ripple"<br>
          the Dead ever performed. Again, the dual mandolins add a nice twinkling sound that fills out the space of
          the<br>
          song very nicely. After "Ripple," is a gorgeous rendition of "To Lay Me Down," sung by a crooning and once
          again<br>
          soulful Jerry Garcia. This "To Lay Me Down" features some nice piano accompaniment, but it is unclear who is
          playing<br>
          piano unfortunately. After "To Lay Me Down," the band picks up the pace with an early version of "Truckin'."
          After "Truckin',"<br>
          Jerry Garcia returns to his bluegrass roots with "Rosalie McFall," a song originally by Charlie Monroe of the
          Monroe Brothers.<br>
          Again accompanied by the mandolins of Grisman and Nelson this "Rosalie McFall" is another fantastic acoustic
          performance by the<br>
          Dead. The band finishes out the first acoustic set with a beautiful "Brokedown Palace," before kicking off the
          electric second <br>
          set with "Casey Jones." Next up is another Grateful Dead special - "Chinacat Sunflower" > "I Know You Rider,"
          which is always <br>
          welcomed in my book! A few songs later, the band busts out a righteous "Sittin' On Top of the World," where in
          the beginning you<br>
          can hear Pigpen's organ subtly humming in the background. A few songs later is a bluesy Pigpen special - "Easy
          Wind." This is the <br>
          first time we hear him singing lead vocals this show. "Easy Wind" is loose, gruff, and rough around the edges,
          just like Pigpen.<br>
          After "Easy Wind" is yet another classic Grateful Dead song - "Sugar Magnolia." This "Sugar Magnolia" is sung
          by Pigpen, which<br>
          is quite a treat, as this likely did not happen very many times before Jerry Garcia took over vocals.
          Harmonies are a bit rough<br>
          at the end of this "Sugar Magnolia," but I suppose jam bands are really not known for their singing. A few
          songs later, the band<br>
          slips in a cover of Merle Haggard's "Mama Tried" with Bob Weir on vocals. Next up, another cover - "Not Fade
          Away" by Buddy Holly.<br>
          This 15 minute version of "Not Fade Away" is a great, jammed out rendition.

        <h3 id="021468">02/14/68 Carousel Ballroom, San Francisco, CA</h3>
        <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/gd68-02-14.sbd.kaplan.15640.sbeok.shnf">Click here to listen to 02/14/68
            at the Carousel Ballroom</a></p>
        <p>Valentine's Day 1968 is a quintessential early Grateful Dead show. The band is deep in the throes of raw
          psychedelic bar band energy during this show.<br>
          This was one of the first Grateful Dead shows that really caught my attention. This show is still very early
          in the Grateful Dead's career, but with a <br>
          keen ear it is not hard to hear the origins of the Dead's later styles.

            the Old Renaissance Faire Grounds</a></p>
        <p>
          Widely regarded as one of the best Grateful Dead shows of all time, the "Sunshine Daydream" show on August 27,
          1972 is one for the books. The band was<br>
          fresh off their Europe '72 tour, and they were very well polished.
