            <li>More to come...</li>
            <p>Here I will go into specifics about what it is that I love about these shows I listed</p>
            <h3 id="92070">9/20/70 Fillmore East New York, NY</h3>
            <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/gd70-09-20.aud.remaster.sirmick.27583.sbeok.shnf/gd70-09-20d1t01.shn">Click here to listen to 9/20/70 at the Fillmore East</a></p>
                <p>This show is divided into two sets, an acoustic first set and electric second set. <br>
                The acoustic first set contains a number of phenomenal songs, starting off with a nice<br> 
                "Uncle John's Band." The acoustic version of this song has a nice warm sound to it, and is all around just a<br>
                nice feel-good type song. Next up, the band plays "Deep Elem Blues," which for them was not<br>
                a very commonly performed song. The Dead only played "Deep Elem Blues" just under 50 times,<br>
                which is almost nothing considering they played "Playing in the Band" a total of 733 times.<br>
                This "Deep Elem Blues" is a very nice, soulful and bluesy vocal performance by Jerry Garcia.<br>
                After "Deep Elem Blues," they play one of their classic originals - "Friend of the Devil."<br>
                This acoustic "Friend of the Devil" is very nicely accented by both David Grisman and David Nelson sitting<br>
                in with the band playing mandolin. Continuing on, another blues song, "Big Railroad Blues," featuring<br>
                fantastic mandolin accompaniment by both David Grisman and David Nelson. After "Big Railroad Blues," comes<br>
                "Dark Hollow" which again features mandolin accompaniment by Grisman and Nelson. This time, however, it is<br>
                Bob Weir singing lead vocals. Next on the set list, is arguably one of, if not the best version of "Ripple"<br>
                the Dead ever performed. Again, the dual mandolins add a nice twinkling sound that fills out the space of the<br>
                song very nicely. After "Ripple," is a gorgeous rendition of "To Lay Me Down," sung by a crooning and once again<br>
                soulful Jerry Garcia. This "To Lay Me Down" features some nice piano accompaniment, but it is unclear who is playing<br>
                piano unfortunately. After "To Lay Me Down," the band picks up the pace with an early version of "Truckin'."
